  Partition disconnected polygon into connected polygons.
  Identifies the groups of boundaries of the polygon
  (two circles are friends, belonging to the same group, if they intersect,
  and friends of friends are friends),
  calls partition_gpoly to partition each group polygon into its parts,
  and combines parts from each group.

  The value of the flag overwrite_original determines whether the
  original polygon in poly is overwritten or not.

   Input: *poly is a polygon.
	  npolys = maximum number of polygons available in polys array.
	  mtol = initial angular tolerance within which to merge multiple intersections.
	  all_oneboundary = 2 to lasso all one-boundary polygons,
			    1 to lasso only those one-boundary polygons
			      with more caps than vertices,
			    0 never to lasso one-boundary polygons;
			    in all cases, all multi-boundary polygons are lassoed.
	  adjust_lasso = how to tighten lasso:
		       = 0 as tight as possible,
			 1 for balkanize,
			 2 for ransack.
	  force_split = 1 to force a polygon to be split
			  even if no boundary can be lassoed;
			0 otherwise.
	  overwrite_original = 2 to overwrite original polygon poly in all cases,
				 whether or not partitioning succeeds;
			       1 to overwrite poly only if partitioning succeeds;
			       0 never to overwrite original poly.
  Output: (*poly and) polys[i], i = 0 to *npoly-1, are the parts of *poly.
	  *npoly = number of polygons in polys;
		   if *npoly > npolys, then there was not enough space.
  Return value: -1 if error occurred;
		 0 if *poly was fully partitioned into its parts;
		 1 if *poly was partially partioned;
		   the parts of *poly constitute a valid set of parts,
		   whose union equals the input *poly,
		   though some parts are disconnected.

  Partition group polygon into connected polygons
  by calling part_poly repeatedly until the group polygon is fully partitioned,
  or until partitioning fails.

  If the group polygon has two or more connected boundaries none of which
  can be lassoed, then the force_split option controls whether part_poly
  should be forced to split the polygon in two.
  If a split is forced, then each of the resulting two polygons is subjected
  to further partitioning, or is in turn forcibly split if necessary.
  If too many forcible splits occur, then it is assumed that the procedure
  is not converging, and the routine bails out.

		      in spite of the failure,
		      polys[i], i = 0 to *npoly-1
		      constitute a valid set of parts,
		      whose union equals the input gpoly;

  Partition a polygon by lassoing its connected boundaries with circles.

  Normally the input polygon poly would be a group polygon,
  all of whose connected boundaries belong to a single group.
  If the boundaries of the input polygon belong to more than one group,
  then the polygon is not simply-connected, and each non-simply-connected part
  of the polygon will contain two or more boundaries.
  The algorithm will attempt to lasso all these boundaries, even though
  lassoing boundaries of a non-simply-connected part of the polygon
  cannot partition the polygon.

  The routine attempts to lasso all the connected boundaries of a polygon,
  unless the polygon has only a single connected boundary.
  If the polygon has a single connected boundary, then
  the all_oneboundary option controls whether or not this boundary is lassoed.

  An attempted lasso is discarded if it lies fully inside or fully outside
  all the caps of the polygon.  It would be incorrect to retain a lasso
  that lies fully inside the polygon, and it would be superfluous to retain
  a lasso that fully encloses the polygon.
  In the normal case where the input polygon is a group polygon,
  a lasso can lie fully inside or outside the caps of the group polygon
  if the group polygon has a single connected boundary.

  If the input polygon has two or more connected boundaries none of which
  can be lassoed, then the force_split option controls whether the
  routine gives up, or else forcibly splits the input polygon into two parts,
  each of which will require further splitting.

   Input: poly is a polygon.
	  npolys = maximum number of polygons available in polys array.
	  mtol = initial angular tolerance within which to merge multiple intersections.
	  all_oneboundary = 2 to lasso all one-boundary polygons,
			    1 to lasso only those one-boundary polygons
			      with more caps than vertices,
			    0 never to lasso one-boundary polygons;
			    in all cases, all multi-boundary polygons are lassoed.
	  adjust_lasso = how to tighten lasso:
		       = 0 as tight as possible,
			 1 for balkanize,
			 2 for ransack.
	  force_split = 1 to force a polygon to be split
			  even if no boundary can be lassoed;
			0 otherwise.
  Output: polys[i], i = 0 to npoly-1, are the connected parts of poly;
              if return value = 0, then:
		  if *npoly = *npoly_try = 0, then:
		      input poly already consists of a single connected part
		      that needs no partitioning;
		  if *npoly = *npoly_try > 0, then:
		      poly was fully partitioned into its parts;
		  if *npoly < *npoly_try then:
