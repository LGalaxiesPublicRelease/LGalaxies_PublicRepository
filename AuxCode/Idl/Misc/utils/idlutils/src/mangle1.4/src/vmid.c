/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Point(s) somewhere in the middle of a polygon.
  The number of points is equal to the number of connected sequences of
  vertices, as computed by gverts, except that if there are zero connected
  sequences, then there is a single midpoint.  Zero connected sequences
  happens when the option to return midpoints for non-intersecting circles is
  turned off in gverts, and each boundary of the polygon is a disjoint circle.

  If the connected sequences of vertices delineate holes in the polygon,
  then the number of connected sequences of vertices may exceed
  the number of connected parts of the polygon.  In this case vmid supplies
  more midpoints than there are connected parts of the polygon.

  The intention is to aim for a point (or points) squarely in the middle of
  the polygon, but the algorithm, though mildly paranoid, is not cast iron.

  Designed to be called after gverts().

  Input: poly = pointer to polygon.
  mtol = initial angular tolerance in radians
  within which to merge multiple intersections.
  nv = number of vertices of polygon, as output by gverts().
  nve = number of points per edge, as input to gverts();
  must be even and >= 2.
  ve = points on edges of polygon, as output by gverts().
  ipv = cap numbers of edges, as output by gverts().
  ev = end indices of connected sequences, as output by gverts().
  Output: *nvm = number of middle points in *vm
  = max(nev, 1).
  *vm_p = pointer to unit vectors giving middle points;
  the required memory is allocated.
  If the algorithm failed to find a point inside the polygon,
  then the vector for that point is {0.,0.,0.}.
  Return value: 0 if ok (even if no inside point was found);
  -1 if failed to allocate memory.
