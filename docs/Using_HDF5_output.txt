Small guide how to use the hdf5 format

=====================================================================

To first use this the hdf5 libs must be installed on your system. 
This can be downloaded and information to install can be found here:

https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html

Once this is done you can now impliment this into L-Galaxies, to do this
you need to add HDF5LIB and HDF5INCL under yoursystem in
Makefile_compilers. For my mac which is a "Darwin" system this is:

		HDF5_LIBS = -L/usr/local/hdf5/lib
		HDF5_INCL = -I/usr/local/hdf5/include 

But this may be different depending on your system. Now to compile
L-Galaxies with HDF5 you need to make sure the option HDF5_OUTPUT is
uncommented in My_Makefile_options. 

You can also set compression on (1) or off (0) to decrease the size 
of the file. It is also possible to change the number of records 
appended at a time, this shouldn't change the I/O time if compression 
is off. But you may experience a slower I/O time with much larger 
records appended, it should decrease the size of the output file but
it does not change by much.

This creates the header file for hdf5 which gives it information about
the data being stored.

An example routine of how to read out the data (in python) is in:

	AuxCode/Python/HDF5/read_lgal_hdf5.py
	AuxCode/Python/HDF5/read_lgal_hdf5.ipynb
